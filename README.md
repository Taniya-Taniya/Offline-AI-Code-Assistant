# AI Code Assistant

An AI-powered code assistant web app that helps you with **code completion**, **debugging suggestions**, and **automatic documentation**.  
Backend is built with Flask and uses Hugging Face's GPT-Neo 125M model.  
Frontend is a static site served separately (e.g., via a local development server on port 3000).

## Features

- **Code Completion:** Continue your code snippets intelligently.
- **Debugging Suggestion:** Find bugs and get fix suggestions.
- **Automatic Documentation:** Generate detailed comments and documentation for your code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Node.js and npm (if you use a frontend dev server like `live-server` or similar)
- Internet connection (required only for initial setup and model download)
